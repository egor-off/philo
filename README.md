# philo
In this project, I will learn the basics of threading a process. I will learn how to make threads and processes. I will discover the mutex and semaphore.<br>

We can start this program with 4 or 5 arguments:
<li>The first argument is the number of philosophers.</li>
<li>The second - is time_to_die in ms.</li>
<li>Third - is time_to_eat in ms.</li>
<li>Forth - is time_to_sleep in ms.</li>
<li>Fifth - is the number of times each philosopher must eat.</li>
<br>
In the mandatory part, each philosopher is a thread and each fork is a mutex.
In the bonus part, each philosopher is a process and forks represented by semaphores.<br>
There is one fork per one philosopher.<br>
If we would start the program with arguments 5 800 200 200, the simulation would never end.<br>
Otherwise, if we would start the program with arguments 4 310 200 100, the simulation would stop at 315 Â±5 ms after the start.<br>
